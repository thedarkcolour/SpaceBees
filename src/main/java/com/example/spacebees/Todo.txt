TODO
------------------
---Cleanup---

Properly credit people from forestry/extrabees etc
Add Honey Drops


---extrabees import---
write scripts
 
    pull branch data from https://github.com/ForestryMC/Binnie/blob/master-MC1.12/extrabees/src/main/java/binnie/extrabees/genetics/ExtraBeeBranchDefinition.java 
    format for CustomBees.java or should I have branches?

    Pull branch information for Taxa? 

Mod intergration?
IC2 replacement? https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ic2-classic 
Botania is Botania https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania



data/tags/blocks/flowers needs following adjustments
leaves.json and wood.json not currently full, there is probably a better way than explicitly naming every wood and leaves "OH YOU LIKE FORESTRY, NAME EVERY LEAF"
mystical.json requires botania flowers, havent added botania yet.
