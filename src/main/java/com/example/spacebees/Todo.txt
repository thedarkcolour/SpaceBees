    format for CustomBees.java or should I have branches?

Mod intergration
IC2 replacement? https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ic2-classic 
Botania is Botania https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/botania



data/tags/blocks/flowers needs following adjustments
leaves.json and wood.json not currently full, there is probably a better way than explicitly naming every wood and leaves "OH YOU LIKE FORESTRY, NAME EVERY LEAF"
mystical.json requires botania flowers, havent added botania yet.
